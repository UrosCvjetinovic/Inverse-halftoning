# Inverse-halftoning

Inverse halftoning method using reversible data hiding for halftone images. Implemented a function that halftones images. Implemented the algorithm described in a research article by Jia-Hong Lee, Mei-YiWu and Hong-JieWu. Algorithm embeds specified information to improve the LUT-base inverse halftoning method using a set of images and their halftones. Embedding is made by replacing common patterns with patterns that werenâ€™t in the original halftone.
